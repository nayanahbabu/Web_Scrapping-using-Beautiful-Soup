## Introduction

Web scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites. In this project, we focus on extracting information about companies operating in Qatar from the Wikipedia page. We use Python and Beautiful Soup, a popular Python library for web scraping, to parse the HTML content of the webpage and extract the desired data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python (version 3 or above)
- Beautiful Soup library (`beautifulsoup4`)

You can install Beautiful Soup using pip:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

## Installation

To use this script, you can either clone this repository or download the files manually.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-scraping-qatar-companies.git
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the directory where the script `web_scrapping_qatar_companies.py` is located.
2. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python web_scrapping_qatar_companies.py
```

3. Once the script has finished running, it will create a CSV file named `qatar_companies.csv` containing the extracted data.
